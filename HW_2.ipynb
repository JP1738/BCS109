        "My name is ***Jeremiah Pinnock***. I am a sophomore. I have **no** prior experience using any coding programs but I have been involved in things like the *LEGO Robotics* so I have experience in working with codes. I've always been fascinated with coding and always watched to learn how. In high school, I used to use the inspect tool on websites. I would alter the code and rewrite things and just watch what happens. I want to possibly get involved in programming for **video games**.  "
